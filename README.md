Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I am Leandro Hermann Sauer. I have 27 years old and I live in Argentina.
I have a bachellor degree in International Trade and I am currently finishing an MBA in International Business.

During the lock-up due to COVID-19, which lasted several months in Argentina, I started learning programming through sites like Coursera, EdX and Udemy.
Since I was 10 or 11 years old I love math and problem-solving, so I really enjoy the process of taking a problem and developing ideas to solve it, in order to finally develop a solution and take on a different problem.

After some basic and intermediate courses mainly in Python, I decided to create this account in order to show some projects I develop in my free time. ðŸŒ±

Currently I am working full-time but in a job not related to programming, and I expect to move into this industry in the next year.

You can reach me in LinkedIn or via email to l.hermannsauer@gmail.com. ðŸ“«
